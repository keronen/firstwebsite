<!-- ### 1. Home Page 
Purpose: Introduce creative work effectively.

  Short Description:
- Write a short description such as: “Unique handmade jewelry and accessories: earrings, bracelets, and crochet items.”  (to be discussed)
  - Featured Products: Highlight 2-3 featured products below the banner. Use HTML grid or flexbox layout to make sure it looks organized (Note: Learn more about what HTML grid and flexbox are and how to use them to make the section visually appealing).
  - Buttons (Call-To-Action or CTA): Create buttons that prompt users to take action. Include buttons like: “Order Now,” “Discover Collection” (to view the gallery), or “Learn More” (to read more about the artist).

  - Split the gallery into categories (e.g., earrings, bracelets, crochet items) and use clickable tabs for each category to make navigation easier.
